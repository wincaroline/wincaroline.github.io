            <h2>Oncologists and research coordinators don't want to see all the trials--just the best ones for their patients.</h2>
            <p>From the interviews and affinity diagram, we pulled out key insights to inform our design approach. One major finding is that there are just so many trials--many of them with hundreds of pages and which are ultimately not a good fit for the patient.</p>
            <!-- <p>Oncologists <strong>heavily rely on Clinical Research Coordinators (CRCs)</strong> for detailed knowledge about clinical trials.</p> -->
            <br>
            <p>Unfortunately, <strong>current systems do not make it convenient</strong> for oncologists and CRCs to find relevant trials for their patients. Trial criteria (for a patient to qualify for a trial) are becoming increasingly complex, intricate, and stringent.</p>

          <p>Overall this project was a wonderful experience with learning how to be a better design consultant and communicate effectively with a client. Initially it was challenging to get on the same page, since the business perspective differed from my priorities as a designer. This involved many back-and-forth discussions, and learning from other design students and my advisor was a great help. Additionally, I was able to learn from the client and gain a clearer idea of how a startup works and the steps and challenges involved.</p>
