        <p class="objectivetext">Increase the number of cancer patients who are properly matched to clinical trials.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Clinical trials are often a last option for cancer patients who are not responding well to standard treatments. However, matching patients to clinical trials successfully is a tedious, time-consuming, and controversial process for health care providers and patients.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The goal of this startup was to make this process easier using artificial intelligence to automate some of the tedious work and a user-friendly platform to connect patients to trials.</p>

        <h2>A stressful and tedious matching process</h2>
        <p>To find a matching trial for a patient, oncologists and clinical research coordinator (CRC) nurses must navigate through hundreds of trials looking for matching diagnoses,  specific criteria, and high quality practices. The documentation for one trial can be hundreds of a pages. With already busy schedules, this can be very difficult and time-consuming, especially for oncologists without a CRC nurse to support them.</p>

      <p class="preheaderblue">SYNTHESIS</p>
      <h2>Oncologists and research coordinators don't want to see all the trials--just the best ones for their patients.</h2>
      <p>From the interviews and affinity diagram, we pulled out key insights to inform our design approach. One major finding is that there are just so many trials--many of them with hundreds of pages and which are ultimately not a good fit for the patient.</p>
      <!-- <p>Oncologists <strong>heavily rely on Clinical Research Coordinators (CRCs)</strong> for detailed knowledge about clinical trials.</p> -->
      <br>
      <p>Unfortunately, <strong>current systems do not make it convenient</strong> for oncologists and CRCs to find relevant trials for their patients. Trial criteria (for a patient to qualify for a trial) are becoming increasingly complex, intricate, and stringent.</p>

    <div class="containernarrow">
      <h3>It can be devastating for patients if matching with a trial doesn't work out.</h3>
      <p>Patients generally <strong>don't trust clinical trials</strong> because they aren't considered standard or best treatments, so they are already coming into the process wary. If they do consider participating in a trial, <strong>cost, travel, and time</strong> can be major barriers.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Given all the barriers to pursuing a trial, in the end patients can become very disappointed if the matching does not work out due to one criteria not being met, for example.</p>

<!-- SECTION 4 - DESIGN -->

    <p class="preheaderblue">DESIGN</p>
    <h2>How can we provide a quick glance of what really are the "best" trials for patients? How do we know what the best trials are?</h2>
    <p>Through interviews with physicians, research coordinators, and behavioral oncologists, we determined key information these providers looked for when considering trials.</p>

        <p>Concepts and layouts were sketched, and these ideas were shared with an oncologist to get feedback on what information would be important to emphasize.</p>

        <h2>Oncologists &amp; CRCs have very limited time, so systems must be integrated, efficient, and easy-to-use.</h2>
        <p>These providers already use multiple different systems, so their feedback primarily focused on how this tool could easily integrate into their existing processes. For example, the tool could automatically pull patients' medical records so the information would not need to be re-entered. Of course, this would require multiple hurdles given the sensitivity of the information.</p>

<!-- SECTION 7 - REFLECTION -->

    <p class="preheaderblue">REFLECTION</p>
    <h2>Balancing client and user needs</h2>
    <p>Overall this project was a wonderful experience with learning how to be a better design consultant and communicate effectively with a client. Initially it was challenging to get on the same page, since the business perspective differed from my priorities as a designer. This involved many back-and-forth discussions, and learning from other design students and my advisor was a great help. Additionally, I was able to learn from the client and gain a clearer idea of how a startup works and the steps and challenges involved.</p>

    <h3>Final Presentation</h3>
    <p>At the end of the 5 month project period, the prototype for EXAID was presented to advisors for feedback and figuring out next steps.</p> -->
