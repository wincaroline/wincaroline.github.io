  <p class="preheaderblue">UNDERSTANDING</p>
  <h2>Deep dive into power management</h2>
  <p>The first few months we spent focusing on primary and secondary research into the domain of power management to understand the different people involved, their needs and tasks, and the switchgear they work with.

    <h3>What are switchgear?</h3>
    <p>Switchgear are like <strong>fuse boxes</strong>, but for large buildings and complexes such as hospitals and universities. They are devices used to protect and control electrical equipment.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Switchgear can contain many components including circuit breakers, fuses, and protective relays. Within a certain distance from switchgear, there can be risk of an <strong>arc flash</strong>, a type of electrical explosion.</p>

    <h3>Secondary research</h3>
    <p>During the Spring, we conducted research on emerging technologies and analagous domains, a competitive analysis, and discussions with engineers to better understand power management and explore possibilities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In analogous domains such as military, aviation, and oil and gas, <strong>augmented reality</strong> in particular is used to provide contextual information to workers in risky sites.</p>

  <p class="preheaderblue">VISIONING</p>
  <h2>Emerging technologies can provide the power to make interactions with switchgear smoother and safer.</h2>
  <p>To tackle the various pain points we discovered through our research, we brainstormed many different ideas, many of which utilized emerging technologies such as augmented reality and conversational design to provide information more efficiently and in context.</p>

    <h3>Sketching concepts</h3>
    <p>From 29 different sketches and ideas, we eventually narrowed down to 11 concepts to evaluate with users, advisors, and peers.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="largespace"></div>

  <div class="halfleft">
    <h3>Concept evaluations</h3>
    <p>These 11 concepts were presented as storyboards to different users, including customers, field service engineers, and remote support teams. Users provided their reactions, what they could see being useful or not, and eventually we narrowed down to 4 concepts to further refine.</p>
