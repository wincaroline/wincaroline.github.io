I'm a UX designer currently working at Wemo, a smart home product brand under Belkin International, Inc., located in Los Angeles, California.  
<br>
Smart homes, education, retirement planning, power management, aviation, and healthcare are the industries I've had UX and product design experience in! I've really enjoyed the variety and seeing how design thinking can benefit all kinds of users and businesses.   
<br>
My background is in Human-Computer Interaction -- I earned my Master's in HCI from Carnegie Mellon University in 2017.   
<br>
Lately I've been enjoying reading mystery novels, painting, planting, cooking, video games, and dancing.
