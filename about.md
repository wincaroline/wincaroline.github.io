I'm a user experience designer currently working at Wemo, a smart home product brand under Belkin International, Inc., located in Los Angeles, California.

Smart homes, education, retirement planning, power management, aviation, and healthcare are the industries I've had UX and product design experience in! I've really enjoyed the variety and seeing how design thinking can benefit all kinds of users and businesses.

My background is in Human-Computer Interaction -- I earned my Master's in HCI from Carnegie Mellon University in 2017.

Overall I love working with teams to solve complex problems, figuring out the best way to find a solution that balances user and business needs and incorporates each team member's ideas and skills.
