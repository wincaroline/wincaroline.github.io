          <p>This project was part of a larger proposal by The OSU College of Medicine to determine whether virtual health coaches (VHCs) can improve glycemic control and other outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <br>
          <p>During the summer of 2014, I was funded by the Bennett Medical Student Research Scholarship to develop a prototype.</p>

        <h2>Understanding health coaching and type 2 diabetes patients</h2>
        <p>To better understand the project vision, users (patients with type 2 diabetes), and coaching techniques, I interviewed stakeholders and conducted secondary research including an ecosystem dump, literature review, and internet research to answer the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What makes health coaching effective?</li>
          <li>What are essential health coaching techniques?</li>
          <li>What are type 2 diabetes patients' greatest concerns with regards to eating habits?</li>
          <li>What are their goals?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is a health coach?</h3>
        <p>A <strong>health coach</strong> is a professional who guides patients in setting behavioral health goals, creating an action plan to achieve those goals, and recognizing and working through challenges.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Shown to be effective in improving health measures such as BMI and blood sugar in patients with diabetes</li>
          <li>Does not give medical advice</li>
           <li>Provides resources and guidance</li>
           <li>Asks self-reflective questions</li>

        <h3>Patients fear long-term consequences</h3>

        <h3>Improving eating habits to lower health risks</h3>
        <p>For patients with type 2 diabetes, having a healthy diet is a vital part of controlling blood sugar and preventing long-term consequences.</p>

        <p>Health coaches help these patients set small achievable goals to work towards healthier habits overall.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Also, virtual health coaches are more accessible than professionals because they can be accessed anywhere.</p>

        <h2>Conversational user interface (CUI) design and agent persona</h2>
        <p>The initial goal was to create a functioning prototype of a CUI that can ask patients relevant health coaching questions and respond appropriately.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Key conversation pathways</h3>
        <p>I first mapped out the key conversation topics and pathways that could occur within the scope of improving eating habits. This also included miscellaneous topics such as introductions, closings, chit chat, and errors (not understanding the user or having a specific response).</p>

      <div class="mediumspace"></div>
      <div class="halftext">
        <h3>Agent persona</h3>
        <p>We decided to use an animated 3D model for the agent given the existing work done at OSU and the ability to simulate a more realistic experience of interacting with a coach. We discussed ideas for the future such as including VHCs of different genders, ages, ethnicities, and art styles.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We focused on the following characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Friendly, calm, and professional</li>
          <li>Cartoon-like appearance to reduce the uncanny valley effect</li>

      <h2>Managing a conversation with infinite possibilities</h2>
      <p>I used my knowledge about health coaching techniques and programming in ChatScript (the AI engine) to develop the conversational functionality of the VHC.</p>

        <h3>Development, testing, &amp; iteration</h3>
        <p>The character was represented visually by an <strong>animated 3D model</strong>, and the two systems were integrated in game engine <strong>Unity</strong>. Finally, the application was combined with a survey and instructions on a web interface.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We sent the prototype to stakeholders to test. As expected, a lot of programming issues and awkward conversations were discovered and subsequently corrected.</p>

        <p class="preheader">CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS</p>
        <h2>Potential to empower people struggling to achieve health goals</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Overall this was a project I was very passionate about since I am interested in digital health. I believe that a virtual health coach could potentially be very <strong>useful for patients who do not have access to an actual professional health coach</strong> or just want a bit of guidance <strong>without worrying about being judged</strong> by another human.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Health coaching itself is <strong>proven to be an effective</strong> technique in improving health outcomes. With the guidance of professional health coaches, the VHC could become a very effective health application.</p>
        <div class="largespace"></div>
        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>Though I moved on to another job after this project, if I were to continue it the next steps of this project would involve:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conducting <strong>user research with actual Type 2 Diabetes patients</strong>, since my research was conducted using diabetes forums and interviews</li>
          <li>Building a more <strong>robust prototype</strong> with the newly designed interface</li>
          <li><strong>Reviewing and testing with stakeholders</strong></li>
          <li>Making improvements based on the testing and feedback and testing the VHC with actual patient volunteers.</li>
        </ul>
