          <br>
          <p>My team's goal was to design and develop a mobile version of Argus's current web application for aviation management. This software allows business aviation professionals such as sales representatives, schedulers, and operations managers to calculate trip quotes and schedule and coordinate highly complex and customized trips for clients.</p>

        <h2>Understanding users, business stakeholders, and the current process</h2>
        <p>To start to understand the business aviation domain, I asked a lot of questions and attended a few sessions on the history of the aviation management system and business aviation in general.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I also spent a few days going through the curent web application to evaluate usability and better understand the mobile application I would be designing.</p>

        <h2>Designing collaboratively with a small team</h2>

        <div class="halftext">

          <h3>Hi-fidelity designs &amp; specifications documents</h3>
          <p>Using Sketch, I created higher-fidelity mockups and added interactivity with InvisionApp to allow team members to test the usability of our team's ideas and to give an idea of the direction we plan to take to other employees at the company.</p>
          <br>
          <p>To transition the designs to developers, I created specifications documents with details on font sizes, colors, spacing, and content.</p>

    <!-- SECTION 4 - CONCLUSION -->

        <p class="preheader">REFLECTION</p>
        <h2>Navigating a highly complex field</h2>
        <p>Overall this was an extremely valuable and exciting experience for me. The members of my team were all such amazing and fun people who respected each others' opinions and loved to communicate openly and bounce ideas off of each other. I think I have been very lucky to work in this environment.</p>
        <div class="mediumspace"></div>
        <p>A few of the challenges included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Business aviation</strong> - a highly complex field with many meticulous tasks and expectaitons</li>
          <li><strong>Differences in opinion</strong> within Argus about design and approach for the management system</li>
          <li>Being an <strong>entry-level designer</strong> and also the only designer in the company</li>
          <li><strong>Explaining design topics</strong> and topics to co-workers unfamiliar with design</li>
        </ul>
