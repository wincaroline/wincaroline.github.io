          <h2>New requirements increase flexibility, but also complexity.</h2>
          <p>In order to reduce errors in the long term and allow for greater flexibility in how employers choose to review and submit their data, the business decided to add pay date level data to this process.</p>
          <br>
          <p>With up to 52 pay dates in a year (e.g. weekly pay), the amount of data we needed to incorporate in the design was <strong>multiplied by up to 52 times</strong>.</p>

          <p>To make sense of all this complexity, I created a diagram of all the different paths and scenarios. This was very helpful in getting everyone on the same page and allowing them to see where all the pieces of the puzzle fell. Feature numbers and related requirements such as notifications and reports allowed stakeholders to easily reference their requirements documents.</p>

          <h2>Usability issues and balancing conflicting views and needs</h2>
          <p>I conducted user tests with 6 users in various roles to determine what worked or didn't work with the initial design. Through these tests and subsequent team discussions, various usability issues and conflicts were revealed.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>While the administrators and internal associates were more concerned with ensuring errors were identified and fixed, customer support representatives did not want to overwhelm Employers with red text and error messages.<strong> We needed to make sure errors were fixed without overwhelming people or causing panic.</strong></li>
            <li>The delay of report generation for an overnight flow caused awkwardness. Users were unsure what to do next.</li>

          <h3>Iteration 2</h3>

          <h3>Iteration 3</h3>

          <p>I think this design process could have been smoother if I spent more time planning and gaining a better understanding of nuances early on. For example, after creating the flow diagram, I could have spent more time reviewing it first with business as well as the design team to discover alternate cases and scenarios. This would have reduced time spent focusing in particular directions and backtracking.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Ideally, we also would have had an opportunity to conduct more rigorous research to better understand user needs. This would be able to give more conclusive information to base design decisions in addition to the opinions of different stakeholders.</p>
