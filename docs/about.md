I'm a user experience designer currently working at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Master's in Human-Computer Interaction in 2017.

I love working with teams to solve complex problems, figuring out the best way to find a solution that balances user and business needs and incorporates each team member's ideas and skills.
