        <h2>Use high-level summaries to get everyone on the same page</h2>
        <p>With so much data and information to go through, it was easy to lose sight of all the considerations and subconsciously make assumptions on what's best for employees.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I think it would have been helpful to create more high-level diagrams or summaries with my team members before starting to design the new navigation. This would put everyone on the same page and help ensure we were accounting for as much of this information as we could.</p>
        <div class="largespace"></div>
        <h3>Consider navigation of the site as a whole rather than in parts</h3>
        <p>Because the project scope was limited, we only focused on the primary navigation menu. However, other parts of the site (e.g. the home page, hub pages, other Nationwide sites) are also part of how employees navigate their intranet. Without considering these, we risked potentially creating redundant navigation or not accounting for all the content available for employees.</p>
